Project Title: Audible Dataset Cleaning and Standardization Using Power Query in Excel

Project Description:

This project involves utilizing Power Query Editor in Excel to clean and standardize an Audible dataset, preparing it for further analysis. The dataset was restructured and transformed by applying a variety of data cleaning and formatting techniques. Below are the key features of the project:

Key Features:
Standardized Name Formatting: Ensured consistent title casing in the 'name' column to standardize the appearance of all book titles.

Separation of Author Names: Split combined first and last names in the 'author' column into distinct first and last name columns to improve data clarity and facilitate further analysis.

Consistent Date Formatting: Reformatted all entries in the 'releasedate' column to a uniform date format (DD-MM-YYYY), ensuring consistency across the dataset.

Time Conversion to Duration Format: Converted the 'time' column from text to a proper duration format recognized by Excel, allowing for accurate time calculations.

Price Column Cleanup: Identified and resolved non-numeric values in the 'price' column, ensuring it is fully numeric for analytical purposes.

Star Ratings Conversion: Converted the 'stars' column, which contained text-based ratings, into numeric values (e.g., 1 to 5) to facilitate quantitative analysis.

Handling Multiple Narrators: Split the 'narratedby' column into multiple columns to manage entries with multiple narrators, ensuring clear data representation.

Merged Columns for Release Information: Combined 'releasedate' and 'language' into a new 'releaseinfo' column with a clear format of "DD-MM-YYYY, Language."

Currency Format Standardization: Standardized the 'price' column to display values consistently with two decimal places, ensuring uniformity in currency formatting.

Tools Used:
Excel Power Query Editor
This project demonstrates expertise in using Power Query to transform raw datasets, applying a series of key data cleaning operations to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis.
